       <p class="">The cost of attending the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) varies depending on factors like residency status, program of study, and housing choices. For Pennsylvania residents, tuition is significantly lower than for out-of-state students. As of recent estimates, in-state undergraduate tuition is around $20,000 per year, while out-of-state students typically pay around $36,000. On top of tuition, students need to budget for housing, meal plans, books, and other personal expenses, which can add another $15,000 to $18,000 annually. Pitt offers both on-campus housing options and opportunities for off-campus living in nearby Oakland, which may influence overall costs.
          <br><br>
        To help manage these costs, Pitt offers a variety of financial aid options, including scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study programs. The university encourages students to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine their eligibility for federal and state aid. Pitt also provides merit-based scholarships for academically strong students, such as the Chancellor's Scholarship, which covers full tuition, room, and board. Other scholarship opportunities target students based on leadership, community service, or specific academic fields. Many students also benefit from federal grants like the Pell Grant or need-based scholarships specific to Pennsylvania residents.
        <br><br>
        In addition to traditional financial aid, Pitt supports students through on-campus employment opportunities, both in academic and administrative departments. These jobs provide students with valuable work experience while helping them cover day-to-day expenses. Pittâ€™s financial aid office offers counseling and resources to help students navigate the financial aspects of their education, ensuring they can access the support they need to make college more affordable. Through a combination of financial aid options, Pitt strives to make higher education accessible to students from diverse backgrounds.
